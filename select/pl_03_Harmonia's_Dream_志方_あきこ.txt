I can't escape this memory
It's like a dream,
it's got me up all night again
And you're all that I can see
But I've been here before
I've crossed so many roads
Never needed more than
I could hold
Running and returning
In a vision, you're a ghost
in black and white
A silhouette in blue and green
I laid awake at night,
and wait for you to come
Been hanging on so hard
and now I can't let go
I'm in a rolling wave
That moves across the line
Am I losing my faith?
We're gonna lose it in time
Leaves are falling down
like rain
In the morning
I just stand alone outside
And I watch 'em blow away
It's so hard to find a friend
these days
Oh I babe, I'm sinking
Summer comes and rain gets in
It's like I'm looking through
the glass on the other side
I'm not tryna make you wait
But I don't need anymore,
and I can't turn back
And give it all away
when it's all I have
I'm in a rolling wave
That moves across the line
Am I losing my faith?
We're gonna lose it in time
Sometimes forwards is
the only way back
To reach the hill in time
I was lost in the light
that can't be seen
Don't move around in front of me
I'm gonna see, I'm on a drive
You lay awake, you know the way
You know the path I'm walking on
Are we the cast
you're leaning on?
You know the coast,
you're on your own
Where I'm going like a light
that can't be seen
Don't look away,
it's just a dream
I'm out of touch,
so out of reach
It's coming back
and I'm moving fast
Just one more day
and I'm home at last
I need that love I'm dreaming on
I know the cost
You're on your own, oh
You're on your own, oh
